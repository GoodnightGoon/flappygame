# Flappy Bird Project
Followed the Flappy Bird project on CodeDex. I've been crushing codewars and training classes so I let myself build something silly and fun just for the heck of it.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript, and Phaser
I haven't used Phaser before. It helped to see WHY javescript was being used.

## Optimizations
I'd like to build off of this. I want to do a bat in a cave kinda thing. Make it look with randomizing columns. Spooky music. All that jazz. If my kids like it, then I've won mom of the year. 

## Lessons Learned:

How to use a framework and assest library with Javascript. Thankfully I was doing my own code, otherwise I notice the writers will purposefully add typos into code along projects! Sneaky sneaky!
